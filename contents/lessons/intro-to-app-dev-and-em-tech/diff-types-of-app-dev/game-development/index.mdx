- **Construct** is a game engine used to create 2D games for
  consoles, computers, and mobile devices. It provides a set of tools
  and libraries for building cross-platform games with events.

The above tools and technologies are commonly used in game development
to create video games for consoles, computers, and mobile devices. Unity,
Unreal Engine, Godot, GameMaker Studio, and Construct are popular game
engines used by game developers to create 2D and 3D games. These game
engines provide a set of tools and libraries for building cross-platform
games with C#, C++, GDScript, and GML.
