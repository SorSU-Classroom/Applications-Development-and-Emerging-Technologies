  for Windows.

The above tools and technologies are commonly used in desktop development
to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux. For
Windows, developers use WinForms and WPF to create desktop applications
with C#. For cross-platform desktop applications, developers use
Electron, JavaFX, and Qt to build desktop applications with web
technologies, Java, and C++.
