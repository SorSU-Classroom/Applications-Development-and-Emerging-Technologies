**Cloud development** is the process of creating cloud-based applications
that run on remote servers. It involves designing the user interface,
writing code, and testing the cloud application for bugs.

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a cloud platform used to create
  cloud-based applications. It was one of the first cloud platforms and
  is widely used by developers to build scalable and secure cloud
  applications. It is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud
  computing platforms and APIs to individuals.

- **Microsoft Azure**, similarly to AWS, is a cloud platform used to
  create cloud-based applications. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing
  service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and
  managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data
  centers.

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, similarly to AWS and Microsoft Azure,
  is a cloud platform used to create cloud-based applications. Google
  Cloud Platform is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the
  same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user
  products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.

- **Heroku** is a cloud platform used to create cloud-based applications.
  It provides a set of tools and services for building scalable and secure
  cloud applications. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting
  several programming languages.

- **Firebase**, also developed by Google, is a cloud platform used to
  create cloud-based applications. Firebase is a platform developed by
  Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an
  independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the
  platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

The above tools and technologies are commonly used in cloud development
to create cloud-based applications that run on remote servers. AWS,
Microsoft Azure, GCP, Heroku, and Firebase are popular cloud platforms
used by developers to build scalable and secure cloud applications. These
cloud platforms provide a set of tools and services for building
cloud-based applications with ease.
