## What are Web Development Libraries?

**Web development libraries** are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionality to help developers build applications more efficiently. Libraries solve common problems, reduce development time, and provide tested, reliable solutions for various tasks. Unlike frameworks, libraries give developers more flexibility in how they structure their applications while providing focused functionality for specific needs.

## Benefits of Using Libraries

Using libraries in web development offers several advantages:

- **Faster Development**: Pre-built solutions reduce the time needed to implement features
- **Code Quality**: Well-maintained libraries are tested by thousands of developers
- **Best Practices**: Libraries often incorporate industry standards and patterns
- **Community Support**: Popular libraries have extensive documentation and community resources
- **Maintenance**: Libraries are regularly updated with bug fixes and new features

## Categories of Web Development Libraries

Web development libraries can be categorized based on their primary functionality:
