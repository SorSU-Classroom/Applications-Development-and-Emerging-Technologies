There are around 3.58 billion internet users on the planet. This implies
that over half of the world's 7.6 billion people have access to the
internet, which they use for everything from entertainment to education,
communication to commerce, keeping up with current events, and keeping
up with business experts. Indeed, for most people, the internet is the 
first (and often only) channel through which we communicate with the
world in all of its complexities.

There are three interactive elements on the internet:

- **Websites** - A collection of web pages that are linked together and
share a common domain name.

- **Servers** - A computer or computer program that manages access to
a centralized resource or service in a network.

- **Browsers** - A software application used to access and view websites
on the internet.

The frontend (client side) and the backend (server side) are two parts of any
website. The frontend comprises everything the user sees and experiences
instantly while visiting a website. The backend is behind the scenes that store,
send and receive information.

HTML, CSS, and Javascript files make up everything a user sees on a website.
As a web developer, these are the most basic tools needed. They are the
languages that required to build websites.
