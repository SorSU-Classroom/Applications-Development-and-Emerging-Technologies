## Cascading

**Cascading** refers to the process of combining multiple style sheets
and resolving conflicts between them. When multiple style rules apply
to the same element, the browser uses a set of rules to determine which
styles to apply.

1. **Specificity** - The more specific rule takes precedence.
2. **Order** - The last rule defined takes precedence.
3. **Importance** - The `!important` rule takes precedence.

In CSS, there are three types of style sheets:

### Inline CSS

The inline style is defined within the `style` attribute of an HTML element. It is used to define styles for a specific element.

```html showLineNumbers
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### Internal CSS

The internal style sheet is defined within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. It is used to define styles for a specific document.

```html showLineNumbers
<style>
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h1>This is a heading.</h1>
```

### External CSS

The external style sheet is a separate file where you can define all the styles that you want to use on your website. You can link the external style sheet to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

```html showLineNumbers
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<h1>This is a heading.</h1>
```

## Specificity

**Specificity** is a set of rules that determines which style rules apply to an element when multiple rules conflict. Specificity is calculated based on the following factors:

1. **Inline Styles** - Inline styles have the highest specificity and override all other styles.
2. **Element Selectors** - Element selectors have the lowest specificity and are overridden by other selectors.
3. **Class Selectors** - Class selectors have a higher specificity than element selectors.
4. **ID Selectors** - ID selectors have a higher specificity than class selectors and element selectors.
5. **!important** - The `!important` rule overrides all other rules and has the highest specificity.
6. **Order of Appearance** - If two rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears last in the style sheet takes precedence.
