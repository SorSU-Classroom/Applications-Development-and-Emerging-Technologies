title: Head Tag - <head>
description: This lesson discusses the Head <head> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag is used to define the head section of the
webpage. The head section contains meta-information
about the document, such as the title, character set,
and viewport. It is not displayed on the webpage but
is used to provide information about the document to
the browser and search engines.

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>First Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<head>` tag. Here, the
`<meta>` tag is used to define the character set and viewport of
the document, while the `<title>` tag is used to define the title
of the document. This title appears in the browser tab.
