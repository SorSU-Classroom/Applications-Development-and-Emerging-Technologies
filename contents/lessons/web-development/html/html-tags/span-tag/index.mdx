title: Span Tag - <span>
description: This lesson discusses the Span <span> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag is used to define a span of text. It is an
inline element that can contain other inline elements.
It is usually used to apply styles to a specific
section of text.

```html showLineNumbers
<p>Welcome to my <span style="color: blue;">website</span>.</p>
```

The code above shows an example of the `<span>` tag. This
tag is used to define a span of text, which can be styled separately from
the rest of the paragraph. In this example, the text "website" is styled
with a blue color.

<iframe
    height="480"
    className="w-full"
    scrolling="no"
    title="CS 321 - C 2.12"
    src="https://codepen.io/godkingjay/embed/QwLJQWq?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true"
    frameBorder="no"
