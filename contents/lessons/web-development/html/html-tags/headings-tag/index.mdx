title: Heading Tag - <h1> to <h6>
description: This lesson discusses the Heading <h1> to <h6> tag and its usage in web development.
---

These tags are used to define headings of different
sizes. The `<h1>` tag defines the largest heading,
while the `<h6>` tag defines the smallest heading.
Headings are used to define the structure of the document
and provide a hierarchy of information.

```html showLineNumbers
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<h1>` to
`<h6>` tags. These tags are used to define headings of
different sizes, with `<h1>` being the largest and
`<h6>` being the smallest.
