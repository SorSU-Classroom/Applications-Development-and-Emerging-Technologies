title: Body Tag - <body>
description: This lesson discusses the Body <body> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag is used to define the body section of the
webpage. The body section contains the content of
the document, such as headings, paragraphs, and
images. It is displayed on the webpage and is
visible to the user.

```html showLineNumbers
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
</body>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<body>` tag. Here, the
`<h1>` tag is used to define a heading, while the `<p>`
tag is used to define a paragraph. This content is displayed on the
webpage and is visible to the user.
