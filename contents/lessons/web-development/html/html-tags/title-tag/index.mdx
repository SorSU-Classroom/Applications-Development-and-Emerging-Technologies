description: This lesson discusses the Title <title> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag is used to define the title of the document.
It appears in the browser tab and is used to identify
the webpage.

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>This is the Title of Your Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<title>` tag. Here, the
title of the document is *This is the Title of Your Page*. This title appears in the
browser tab when the document is opened.
