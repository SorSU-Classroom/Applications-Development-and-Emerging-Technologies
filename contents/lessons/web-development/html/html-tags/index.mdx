title: HTML Tags
description: This lesson discusses HTML tags and their usage in web development.
---

**HTML Tags** are used to define the structure and content of a web page.
They are enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs: an opening tag
and a closing tag. The opening tag is used to define the beginning of
an element, while the closing tag is used to define the end of an element.

When an HTML tag is opened, it must be closed to avoid errors. Some tags
are self-closing, meaning they do not require a closing tag. HTML tags
can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the
element.

```html showLineNumbers
<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
```

The above code shows an example of an HTML tag with an
opening tag `<p>` and a closing tag `</p>`. The content
of the paragraph is "Welcome to my website.".

```html showLineNumbers
<img src="https://avatar.iran.liara.run/public" alt="Image" />
```

The above code shows an example of an HTML tag that is
self-closing `<img />`. This tag is used to insert an image into
the document. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image,
while the `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image.
