This tag is used to insert a horizontal rule in the
document. It is a self-closing tag that creates a
horizontal line across the page. It can be used
to separate sections of content or to create a
visual break in the document.

```html showLineNumbers
<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
```

The code above shows an example of the `<hr />` tag. This
tag is used to insert a horizontal rule in the document, which creates
a horizontal line across the page.
