title: HTML Tag - <html>
description: This lesson discusses the HTML <html> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag specifies that the webpage is written
in HTML. It appears at the very first and last line
of the webpage. It is mainly used to show that
the page uses HTML5 – the latest version of
the language. Also known as the root element,
this tag can be thought of as a parent tag for
every other tag used in the page.

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</html>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<html>` tag. Here, the
`lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which
is English in this case.

When an HTML tag is opened, it must be closed to avoid errors. Some tags
are self-closing, meaning they do not require a closing tag. HTML tags
can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the
element.

```html showLineNumbers
<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
```

The above code shows an example of an HTML tag with an
opening tag `<p>` and a closing tag `</p>`. The content
of the paragraph is "Welcome to my website.".

```html showLineNumbers
<img src="https://avatar.iran.liara.run/public" alt="Image" />
```

The above code shows an example of an HTML tag that is
self-closing `<img />`. This tag is used to insert an image into
the document. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image,
while the `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image.
