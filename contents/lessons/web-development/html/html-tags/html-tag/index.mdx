title: HTML Tag - <html>
description: This lesson discusses the HTML <html> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag specifies that the webpage is written
in HTML. It appears at the very first and last line
of the webpage. It is mainly used to show that
the page uses HTML5 – the latest version of
the language. Also known as the root element,
this tag can be thought of as a parent tag for
every other tag used in the page.

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</html>
```

The above code shows an example of the `<html>` tag. Here, the
`lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which
is English in this case.
