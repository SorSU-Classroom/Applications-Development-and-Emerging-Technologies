title: Line Break Tag - <br>
description: This lesson discusses the Line Break <br> tag and its usage in web development.
---

This tag is used to insert a line break in the document.
It is a self-closing tag that does not require a closing tag.
When used, it moves the content to the next line. In texts,
it is used to separate paragraphs or lines.

```html showLineNumbers
<p>Welcome to my <br /> website.</p>
```

The code above shows an example of the `<br />` tag. This
tag is used to insert a line break in the document, which moves the
content to the next line.
