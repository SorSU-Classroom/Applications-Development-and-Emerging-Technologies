An **application** is a software program that allows users to
perform specific tasks. Applications for desktop or laptop computers
are sometimes called **desktop applications**, while those for
mobile devices are called **mobile apps**. When you open an
application, it runs inside the operating system until you close it.
Most of the time, you will have more than one application open at
the same time, which is known as **multitasking**.

**Development** is the process of creating a software application.
It includes designing the user interface, writing code, and testing
the application for bugs. The goal of software development is to
create a program that is easy to use and works correctly.
