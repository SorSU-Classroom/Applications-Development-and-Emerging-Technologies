## Pages

A page is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a page
file inside the app directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (/):

```bash
app/
├── page.js
```

```jsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>;
}
```

The code above shows an example of creating a page in NextJS. The `page.js` file exports a React component that renders an `h1` element with the text "Hello, Next.js!".

## Layouts

A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts
preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout
file. The component should accept a children prop which can be a page or
another layout.

For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a
layout file inside the app directory:

```bash
app/
├── layout.js
├── page.js
```

```jsx
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Layout</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The code above shows an example of creating a layout in
NextJS. The `layout.js` file exports a React component that renders an
`h1` element with the text "My Layout" and accepts a `children`
prop to render the child components.

## Reusable Components

Reusable components are UI elements that can be shared across multiple pages
and layouts. You can create reusable components by defining React components
and importing them into your pages and layouts.

For example, to create a reusable button component, define a button file inside
the components directory:

```bash
components/
├── button.js
app/
├── layout.js
├── page.js
```

```jsx
export default function Button({ children }) {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
}
```

The code above shows an example of creating a
reusable button component in NextJS. The `button.js` file exports a
React component that renders a `button` element with the children passed
as props.
