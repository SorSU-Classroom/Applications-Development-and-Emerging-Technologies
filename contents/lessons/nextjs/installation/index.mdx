## Pre-requisites

Before installing NextJS, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website. npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately. You can download Node.js from the following link:

## Automatic Installation

You can create a new NextJS project using the `create-next-app` command provided by the NextJS team. This command sets up a new NextJS project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
