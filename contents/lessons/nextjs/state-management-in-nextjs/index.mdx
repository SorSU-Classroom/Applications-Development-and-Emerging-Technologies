title: State Management
description: This lesson will introduce you to state management in NextJS, a React framework that provides built-in support for managing state in components.

## Local State

Local state in NextJS can be managed using React's built-in `useState` hook. You can define state variables and update them using the `useState` hook in functional components.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The code above shows an example of managing local state in NextJS using the `useState` hook. The `Counter` component defines a `count` state variable and an `increment` function to update the count value.

## Global State

Global state in NextJS can be managed using external state management libraries such as Redux, MobX, React Context API, Recoil, Zustand, or SWR. These libraries provide a way to share state across components and manage complex state interactions in the application.
