## Link Component

The `Link` component in NextJS is used to navigate between pages in the application. It is an optimized component that pre-fetches linked pages in the background to improve performance and provide a seamless navigation experience.

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        About
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The code above shows an example of using the `Link` component in NextJS to create a link to the about page. The `Link` component accepts the `href` prop with the path to the linked page.

## Dynamic Routes

A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: `[folderName]`. For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`.

Dynamic Segments are passed as the `params` prop to `layout`, `page`, `route`, and `generateMetadata` functions.

```bash
app/
├── blog/
│   └── [slug]
│       └── page.js
```

```jsx
export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const slug = (await params).slug;
  return (<div>My Post: {slug}</div>);
}
```

The code above shows an example of using dynamic routes in NextJS. The `[slug]/page.js` file accepts the `params` prop and extracts the `slug` value to render the post content.

## Nested Routes

Nested routes can be created by nesting folders inside the pages directory. Each folder represents a nested route, and each file inside the folder represents a page in the nested route.

```bash
pages/
├── blog/
│   └── [slug]
│   │   └── page.js
│   └── page.js
```

The example above shows the structure of nested routes in NextJS. The `blog/[slug]/page.js` file represents a dynamic post page, and the `blog/page.js` file represents the blog index page.
